This project aims to develop a localization system tailored for a robot navigating
environments featuring multiple landmarks/beacons. It involves implementing
the Extended Kalman Filter alongside suitable motion and observation models.
The primary output of our simulation will include the successive estimation
of the robotâ€™s positions along its trajectory. Maximizing beacon utilization
is prioritized, though potential beacon detection failures require strategies for
handling missing information within the observation function. The ensuing
report will detail the implementation of this simulation utilizing the Extended
Kalman Filter and delve into discussions on various simulation parameters and
their impacts.

This assignment was developed for the first project of Mobile Robotics in april 2024 in Aveiro University, Portugal.
